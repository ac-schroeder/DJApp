The DJ App is a simplified DJ controller desktop application built with C++ and the JUCE framework. It allows the loading of music files into two decks for simultaneous playback with waveform display. Playback can be modified through volume faders, speed and position controls, and simplified EQ adjusters.  

This app was built from a coursework project for an OOP course.
